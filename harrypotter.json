Could the discovery of cosmic \"gravity-shielding effects\" unlock the secret to the Nimbus 2000 broomstick's ability to fly? Is the griffin really none other than the dinosaur Protoceratops? Roger Highfield, author of the critically acclaimed The Physics of Christmas, explores the fascinating links between magic and science to reveal that much of what strikes us as supremely strange in the Potter books can actually be explained by the conjurings of the scientific mind. This is the perfect guide for parents who want to teach their children science through their favorite adventures as well as for the millions of adult fans of the series intrigued by its marvels and mysteries. â€¢ An ALA Booklist Editors' Choice â€¢",

The twists and turns of the series, as well as the psychological depth and complexity of J. K. Rowlingâ€™s characters, have kept fans enthralled with and puzzling over the many mysteries that permeate Hogwarts and beyond: â€¢ Do the Harry Potter books encourage disobedience? â€¢ Why is everyone so fascinated by Professor Lupin? â€¢ What exactly will Harry and his friends do when they finally pass those N.E.W.T.s? â€¢ Do even wizards live by the ticking of the clock? â€¢ Is Harry destined to end up alone? And why did it take Ron and Hermione so long to get together? Now, in The Psychology of Harry Potter, leading psychologists delve into the ultimate Chamber of Secrets, analyzing human mind and motivation by examining the themes and characters that make the Harry Potter books the bestselling fantasy series of all time. Grab a spot on the nearest couch, and settle in for some fresh revelations about our favorite young wizard!",
